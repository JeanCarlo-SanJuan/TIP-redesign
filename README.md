# TIP-redesign
Final Project for CS-001

Note for coder.php:
It is not part of the source code, its role is to compile all the source code into one html file which can then be saved as PDF when viewed from the browser. 
That pdf file can then be converted to a docx file using a 3rd party app of your preference. 
For file changes, contact me to regenerate the document file as php won't work without a local php server.
