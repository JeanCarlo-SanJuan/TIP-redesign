              The T.I.P. Implementation of outcomes-based education was driven
              by the following external entities:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Regulatory bodies such as the Commission on Higher Education
                (CHED), the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC),
                International Maritime Organization (IMO), among others,
              </li>
              <li>
                Local and international accrediting bodies, specifically, the
                Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission
                on Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine Technological
                Council-Accreditation and Certification Board for Engineering
                and Technology - Engineering Accreditation Commission (PTC -
                ACBET - EAC), and ABET, Inc.,
              </li>
              <li>
                International certifying bodies, and 4) Feedback from other
                external constituents.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              It is also guided by existing T.I.P. internal policies and
              initiatives:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The T.I.P. Vision, Mission, Core Values, and Core Competencies,
              </li>
              <li>.I.P. Quality Policy, and</li>
              <li>
                Other T.I.P. initiatives that supported the OBE implementation
                such as a) the T.I.P. Faculty and Staff Development Program, and
                b) The T.I.P. Student Development Program.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the
              T.I.P. graduates attributes. Outcomes at the program level and
              course level were also formulated aligned with institutional
              outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation
              revolves around three important elements:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs),</li>
              <li>eaching and Learning Activities (TLAs) and</li>
              <li>Assessment Tasks (ATs).</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy
              to promote academic excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a
              proactive plan to implement outcomes-based teaching and learning
              or OBTL in all its academic programs using the City University of
              Hong Kong OBTL model.
            </p>
            <p>
              The OBE process is also supported by facilities, management
              processes and procedures resources and support structures
              sub-systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of the assessment and evaluation are used as inputs in
              the continual improvement of the instructional process
              specifically on the constructive alignment of ILOs, TLAs, and ATs.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is expected that the implementation of OBTL as part of T.I.P.’s
              OBE would hasten the realization of T.I.P.’s mission "to transform
              students into graduates with full competence in their fields of
              study and who also possess Filipino values, industry-desired
              values, and global citizen values”.

            In recent years, T.I.P. had the privilege to receive international
            and national recognitions for providing quality education to
            students. The said recognitions are the following:
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>
              <u>ISO Certification</u>
              - T.I.P.’s quality management system is certified to ISO 9001:2015
              by Det Norske Veritas – Germanischer Lloyd (DNV-GL) in the
              provision of all its academic offerings.
            </p>
            <p>
              This helps ensure that all training and education services
              consistently meet all customer and applicable statutory,
              regulatory and accreditation requirements. This also helps address
              customer satisfaction through the effective and efficient
              application of the system, continual improvement, and the
              prevention of nonconformity. T.I.P. is one among a select number
              of schools in the Philippines which went into ISO certification as
              early as 19 years ago. To date, it continues to maintain its ISO
              certification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the notable components of T.I.P.’s QMS are: a) 5S, a
              Japanese-inspired good housekeeping program, and b) KAIZEN, a
              continuous small-steps improvement program.
            </p>
            <p>
              There can be no clearer confirmation of effective quality
              management than the distinction of being benchmarked by one’s
              peers. Through the years, the institution has hosted several
              benchmarking visits by presidents, officers, faculty and staff of
              other institutions of higher learning, and other organizations,
              bringing to fore its modest contribution to the sharing of
              effective policies and practices. To date, forty eight (48) local
              institutions and organizations have benchmarked with T.I.P.
              Schools from Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia have also
              benchmarked with the institution.
